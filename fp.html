    <p><p><font face="timesnewroman" size="10" color="blue"> This project had many steps. I began by doing a 3-D print for the handle, with Fusion 360 being my software, though this ended up being too small. I reprinted, editing the scale in maker-bot and created slots for some ports. I then purchased some battery powered LEDs and clear plastic tubing. I removed a case for the battery slots of the battery powered LEDs and sautered the LEDs to a smaller battery, and a switch. Around this time, I spray painted the light saber handle. Also, I found at this time, that the makerspace had some LED strips. I got one and sautered it to be blue, though I had some trouble with the wiring, so I resautered it to be green and sautered it to a sqitch as well. Next, I used the plastic tube and cut slots in it so I could pop the buttons through and leave the batteries in the handle. Finally I added a sticker I printed on the Roland 540-i. This with all the roadblocks took about a week.  </font><p></p>

 <p><h3><font face="timesnewroman" size="20" color="blue">Focus 3:Rastering a tall glass. I first made the design on CorelDraw, using LOBSTER, my favorite font. One thing that differed from mynormal engraving, was that the CorelDraw file had to be sideways so it could be printed on the glass which was held by the rotary on the laser printer. Looking back, I would have moved the file up on the sheet first, in order to avoid the text printing so low on the glass. </font></h3></p>
